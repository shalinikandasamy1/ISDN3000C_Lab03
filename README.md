# Lab 3: RDK X5 AI Vision Tasks

This repository contains my work for the Lab 3 assignment.

## Basic Task

The basic task involved running a classifier on a single image and displaying the result on a webpage hosted by the RDK. A screenshot of this task is in `result.png`.

## Advanced Task: Batch Image Classification

The advanced task involved creating a Python script (`classify_batch.py`) that processes an entire folder of images and outputs the classification results into a structured CSV file.

- **Script:** `classify_batch.py`
- **How to Run:** `python3 classify_batch.py <path_to_folder>`
- **Output:** The script generates `results.csv`.

### Result Summary

The script was run on a folder containing [e.g., 12] images across [e.g., 5] classes. The full, machine-readable output is available in the `results.csv` file included in this repository.
